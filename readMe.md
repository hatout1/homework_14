## `1.) Group members involved`

**Mohamed Htout**

## `2.) summary of app (user exp)`

The app would be about food recipes app which will offer a space to users to share their receipts and comment other’s recipes. It also would have a space for for recipes that are generated using ajax.
if there is enough time left at the end, I would try to make an area for grocery list to help user to make their own private list of items that they need to buy.

## `3.) min goals for the app.`

* Public can see recipes and comments.

* To add a comment user should sign.

* Users can share their own recipes.

* User can see others' recipes.

* Users can rate the recipes.



## `4.) stretch goals. save these for last`

I would try to make an area for grocery list to help user to make their own private list of items that they need to buy.
